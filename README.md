# Introduction

Over the years, I have amassed a relatively substantial collection of technical writing and documentation that I use periodically for personal and professional projects. In the past, I have created blog entries on [https://mattsimpson.ca](https://mattsimpson.ca) that document snippets or specific solutions I have unearthed, but I have never had "a place" where I can cleanly maintain and open-source my writing. This is now that place.

Welcome, and I hope that you find portions of the documentation useful.
